# Food for All Header and Footer Documentation

## Basic Rundown
    - Do NOT temper around with format of the CSS linking in Base.html (I'm following the Jinja semantic)

    - Tempering with the CSS semantic in Base.html will cause the link to not proper

    - 'base.html' is the base template for what is needed throughout ALL webpages
    (In this case, it is the Header and Footer)

    - 'home.html' is a placeholder (There's nothing much there)

    - static folder has all assets and CSS Styling for base.html

    - includes folder has _footer.html & _navbar.html

## Setup

    All and all, this is a basic integration
    By default able to just implement this by dragging and dropping in to your current repo

## Extras

    All HTML and CSS are with comments to help you better understand
